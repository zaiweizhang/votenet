### Prepare S3DIS Data

1. Download S3DIS data [HERE](http://buildingparser.stanford.edu/dataset.html). The link may be hard to reach. There are other data sources, such as [here](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet/tree/master/sem_seg).

2. You can use process_data.py to process the dataset. Please change the path accordingly.
